# moonbot
...trying to get to Carnegie Hall :)


having some fun with slack. This will eventually be a moonbot that alerts me and few othes to important moon phases.

##USER STORIES
1. I can ask/receive a text answer on current moon phase.
2. I can ask/receive an image of the current moon phase. 

3. I can receive ephemeral notification of a full moon.
4. I can receive ephemeral notification of a new moon.
5. I can receive ephemeral notification of a super moon.
6. I can receive ephemeral notification of a lunar eclipse.

The first two user stories - text answer and image of the current moon phase - can likely be accomplished by a slash notification. The rest will likely require a bot. In reading slack's API documentation I could( and might) build it out as an app that can by accessed by other interested teams.  

I'll start with the first two user stories while I evaluate what lang to use for the bot. I'm leaning towards Ruby, but I may use python or C#. 

Update: 22/12/16 I went ahead an attempted a full app. Need to revise user stories.
