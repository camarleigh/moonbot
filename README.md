# moonbot
...trying to get to Carnegie Hall :)


having some fun with slack. This will eventually be a moonbot that alerts me and few othes to important moon phases.

##USER STORIES
*I can ask/receive a text answer on current moon phase.
*I can ask/receive an image of the current moon phase. 
* these first two will likely be done with slash notifications.*
*I can receive ephemeral notification of a full moon.
*I can receive ephemeral notification of a new moon.
*I can receive ephemeral notification of a super moon.
*I can receive ephemeral notification of a lunar eclipse.

The first two user stories - text answer and image of the current moon phase - can likely be accomplished by a slash notification. The rest will likely require a bot. In reading slack's API documentation I could( and might) build it out as an app that can by accessed by other interested teams.  

I'll start with the first two user stories while I evaluate what lang to use for the bot. I'm leaning towards Ruby, but I may use python or C#.
